    "\n",
    "With an ever-growing volume of financial data related to loans granted for diverse development projects across countries, there is a critical need to harness the power of SQL queries for systematic exploration and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary challenge is to design and implement SQL queries capable of extracting pertinent information from the dataset. These queries should cover a spectrum of analytical dimensions, including temporal trends, regional patterns, risk assessments, and comparative analyses among countries and sectors\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "#### Data Retrieval \n",
    "Retrieve the World Bank Loan dataset from the data_worldbank.csv file that is stored in csv format\n",

    "## Approach\n",
    "#### Data Import and Initial Exploration\n",
    "In data analysis, the initial step of importing a dataset and exploring its initial content is akin to opening a door to valuable insights.

This task is essential to understand the countries with significant financial commitments. By employing the provided query to sum the \"Original Principal Amount\" and subtract the \"Cancelled Amount,\" we calculate the total loan amount in billions for each country. This information provides insights into the financial scale of World Bank loans in different countries, guiding resource allocation and financial assessment.\n"
